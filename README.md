# repo_from_hell
This repo is too hot to be reviewed by mere mortals!

Hello! This is my repository for putting all of the junk i create on my learning path of GitHub, web development, C++, Linux shell scripting, and alghoritms and data structures.
Feel free to look into any of the files and folders, but i warn you! You do that of your own free will, and it's not my responsibility what happens to you after reviewing my code!

Enjoy the repo_from_hell!

#FAREWELL
